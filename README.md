This is a quadcopter built for stm32f3 micro controllers
It uses [stm32cubemx](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html) to generate the microcontroller configuration and Makefile

Some of the generated files have been modified slightly to easily work with c++ but should not break with regeneration
